Figures in the previous slide gives the plot between memory usage vs. time for the background subtraction code(left figure) and masking code(right figure).​

Background subtraction code uses memory of 250 MiB at time t=6secs whereas masking code uses memory of 120 MiB at t = 6 secs. Hence, we can conclude that masking code takes lesser memory compared to background subtraction code.


Timing Performance:
The total time taken by background subtraction code is more compared to that of masking code. Background subtraction code takes total time of 30.6979 seconds whereas the masking code takes total time of 21.2122 seconds. It can be concluded that the masking code is faster than the background subtraction code.​

​

Per Hit is the average amount of time spent executing the line once in the timer's units. In background subtraction code, around 5-6 lines have per hit greater than 40,000 which makes it slower than than the masking code which has around 2 lines having per hit greater than 40,000.​​
