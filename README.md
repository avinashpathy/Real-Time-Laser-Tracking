<h1>Real Time Laser Tracking</h1>

<p> This project uses OpenCV-python to detect and track real time laser point and detailed analysis on the response time of the algorithm was made. A real time performance of two algorithms was used for laser tracking. </p>
<p> The two algorithms used in this project are masking algorithm and Background subtraction algorithm. </p>
